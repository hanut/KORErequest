KORErequest
===========

A small AS3 class to help you send and receive URL requests with ease. Just import the class, create a KORErequest object and add your target url and vars. And you are done! Works with any server that accepts HTTP style requests
(Perfect for REST or HTTPRequest style data fetching or sending).

No need for passing a random url parameter to overcome the problem with flash web caching. Each request automatically uses the timestamp
to generate a random url. All the data is sent via POST however so no worries.

Includes a tutorial FLA to get you started using the class.
